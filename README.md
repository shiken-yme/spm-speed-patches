# SPM Speed Patches Mod
This mod makes several theoretical sequence breaks in the Super Paper Mario Any% speedrun real, all while making as few changes as possible to the game & without giving the player any extra items, stats, Pixls, or characters.

Install this mod as you would any other Riivolution mod on console or Dolphin; download can be found [here.](https://github.com/shiken-yme/spm-speed-patches/releases) I do not feel like creating a "how to Riivolution" tutorial at this time.

To run this mod on Dolphin, be sure to add/enable the REL Loader Gecko code for your version before running the game with Riivolution patches. You can find the codes [here.](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-rel-loader/tree/master/spm-rel-loader/loader)

## Skips
**Chapter 1 Wrong Warp**

* *Inspired by a theoretical 20-minute timesave: if you were able to open the pause menu and Return Pipe exactly 1 frame before the game normally gives you control of Mario, you'd be able to skip a sequence change and re-enter Chapter 1, causing the game to wrong warp you to the Bleck cutscene at the end of Chapter 1.*

* To perform this skip, Return Pipe at any point after entering Chapter 1-1 without triggering another sequence change (i.e. entering Bestovius' house), then re-enter the Chapter 1 door.

**Pre-Chapter 2 Peach Intermission Skip**

* *Inspired by a theoretical skip very well-known to the SPM speedrunning community: if you were able to get over the high wall with Peach at the very beginning of the Pre-Chapter 2 intermission in Castle Bleck, you'd be able to open a lock, progress through several rooms, save the game, reload, and regain control of Mario in a Chapter 8 sequence.*

* To perform this skip, walk into the wall and jump to reveal a hidden block that allows you to clear the wall. Also, enjoy the unused music :)

## Other Patches
* Bowser is no longer required to reveal the stairs in Chapter 8-1.
* Dimentio no longer leaves rifts in 8-3 in favor of blue switches, removing the need for Fleep.
* TIppi is no longer required to reveal the hidden door in 8-4.
